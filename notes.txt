# Comet Page Reader Notes

## Purpose of the Program
- Provides a browser extension that extracts readable sections from any webpage, summarises the content with AI providers, and plays the results aloud for accessibility.
- Centralises API usage inside the background service worker so keys and billing controls stay private and enforceable.

## Installation Instructions
- Install Node.js 20+ and npm for running automated checks.
- Load the extension as an unpacked WebExtension:
  - **Chromium browsers:** Enable Developer Mode in chrome://extensions, choose Load unpacked, and select this repository.
  - **Firefox:** Visit about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox, choose Load Temporary Add-on, and select manifest.json.
- Optional: run npm install to fetch dev dependencies for the Node-based tests.
- Provision API credentials for the providers you plan to use:
  - **OpenAI:** set the key via the popup or export `OPENAI_API_KEY` before running background scripts.
  - **Google Gemini:** set the key via the popup or export `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` (Gemini currently exposes summarisation only).

## How to Use It
1. Open the Comet Page Reader popup from the browser toolbar.
2. Select a provider, enter the matching API key, and press Save key to store it in background storage.
3. Pick a language and voice profile (voice applies when the active provider supports text-to-speech), then choose an action:
   - Summarise page: Generates summaries for each detected segment.
   - Read aloud: Requests speech synthesis for the leading summary (requires a provider with TTS support, e.g. OpenAI).
   - Push to talk: Holds the microphone button for voice commands that map to extension actions (requires transcription support).
4. Review the usage panel for running token totals and reset the meter when needed.
5. Use the highlighted segments on the page to cross-reference generated summaries.

## How It Works Internally
- Content script (content/content.js): Extracts visible text, tracks DOM mutations, and synchronises segment metadata with the background worker.
- Background service worker (background/service_worker.js): Manages provider selection, caches summaries, enforces token limits, and fulfils popup requests.
- Adapters (background/adapters/*.js): Wrap individual AI providers so the service worker can switch implementations without changing the call sites.
- Utilities (utils/*.js): Provide usage tracking, localisation, audio helpers, DOM traversal, and secure storage abstractions for both runtime and tests.
- Popup UI (popup/): Presents controls for API keys, language/voice preferences, and summary playback while displaying usage statistics.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Missing API key: The popup shows an error banner; open the settings panel and re-save the key. Stored keys live only inside extension storage.
- Exceeded token limit: The popup usage panel indicates limit breaches. Adjust DEFAULT_TOKEN_LIMIT in utils/cost.js or reset the usage counter.
- Content script not responding: Reload the target tab; some browser pages block extension scripts.
- Audio playback fails: Confirm the selected voice is available, that the provider supports speech synthesis, and that the browser has permission to use the speaker and microphone.
- Provider limitations: Gemini only handles summarisation and will return descriptive errors when asked to transcribe or synthesise speech; switch to OpenAI or another audio-capable provider for those features.
- Debugging: Check the browser devtools consoles for the content script, popup, and background worker. Node-based tests log details to the terminal, and cached data persists via chrome.storage for easier inspection.
